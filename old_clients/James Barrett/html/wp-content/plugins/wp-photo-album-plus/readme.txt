== Installation ==

= Upgrade notice =
This version is: Major rev# 2, Minor rev# 4, Fix rev# 4.
If you are upgrading from a previous Major or Minor version, note that:
* If you modified wppa_theme.php and/or wppa_style.css, you will have to use the newly supplied versions. The previous versions are NOT compatible.
* If you set the userlevel to anything else than 'administrator' you may have to set it again. Note that changing the userlevel can be done by the administrator only!
* You may have to activate the sidebar widget again.

= Standard installation when not from the wp plugins page =
* Unzip and upload the wppa plugin folder to wp-content/plugins/
* Make sure that the folder wp-content/uploads/ exists and is writable by the server (CHMOD 755)
* Activate the plugin in WP Admin -> Plugins.
* If, after installation, you are unable to upload photos, check the existance and rights (CHMOD 755)
of the folders wp-content/uploads/wppa/ and wp-content/uploads/wppa/thumbs/. 
In rare cases you will need to create them manually.
* If you upgraded from WP Photo Album (without plus) and you had copied wppa_theme.php and/or wppa_style.css 
to your theme directory, you must remove them or replace them with the newly supplied versions.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What to do if i get errors during upload or import photos? =

* It is always the best to downsize your photos to the Full Size before uploading. It is the fastest and safest way to add photos tou your photo albums.
Photos that are way too large take unnessesary long time to download, so your visitors will expierience a slow website. 
Therefor the photos should not be larger (in terms of pixelsizes) than the largest size you are going to display them on the screen.
WP-photo-album-plus is capable to downsize the photos for you, but very often this fails because of configuration problems. 
Here is explained why:
Modern cameras produce photos of 7 megapixels or even more. To downsize the photos to either an automaticly downsized photo or
even a thumbnail image, the server has to create internally a fullsize fullcolor image of the photo you are uploading/importing.
This will require one byte of memory for each color (Red, Green, Blue) and for every pixel. 
So, apart form the memory required for the server's program and the resized image, you will need 21 MB (or even more) of memory just for the intermediate image.
As most hosting providers do not allow you more than 32 MB, you will get 'Out of memory' errormessages when you try to upload large pictures.
You can configure WP to use 64 MB (That would be enough in most cases) by specifying `define(‘WP_MEMORY_LIMIT’, ‘64M’);` in wp-config.php, 
but, as explained earlier, this does not help when your hosting provider does not allows the use of that much memory.
If you have control over the server yourself: configure it to allow the use of enough memory.
Oh, just Google on 'picture resizer' and you will find a bunch of free programs that will easily perform the resizing task for you.

= How does the search widget work? =

* A space between words means AND, a comma between words means OR.
Example: search for 'one two, three four, five' gives a result when either 'one' AND 'two' appears in the same (combination of) name and description. 
If it matches the name and description of an album, you get the album, and photo vice versa.
OR this might apply for ('three' AND 'four') OR 'five'. Albums and photos are returned on one page, regardless of pagination settings, if any. 
That's the way it is designed.

= How can i translate the plugin into my language? =

* Find on internet the free program POEDIT, and learn how it works.
* Use the file wppa_theme.pot and wppa.pot that is located in wp-photo-album-plus/langs to create or update
wppa-[your languagecode].po, wppa-[your languagecode].mo, wppa_theme-[your languagecode].po and wppa_theme-[your languagecode].mo.
If you want to translate the frontend only (the theme part, only approx. 50 words) you only need to make the wppa_theme-[your languagecode] - files.
* Place these files in the langs subdir.
* If everything is ok, mail me the files and i will distribute them so other users can use your translation too.
* For more information on POT files, domains, gettext and i18n have a look at the I18n for 
WordPress developers Codex page and more specifically at the section about themes and plugins.

* You can link the photo of the day to a full-size photo on its own or in a slideshow/browseable or to the current photos album contents display (thumbnails).
* You can set the thumbnail display type to --- none ---. This removes the 'View .. photos' link on album covers, while keeping the 'View .. albums' link.
* When the Slideshow is disabled and there are more than the photocount treshold photos, the 'Slideshow'-link is changed to 'Browse photos' with the corresponding action.
* The front end (theme) is now seperately translatable. Only 43 words/small sentences need translation. A potfile is included (wppa_theme.pot).
* You can now easy copy a single photo to an other album in the Photo Albums -> Edit album admin page.
* There is a new script command: %%mphoto=..%%. This is an alternative for %%photo=..%% and displays the single photo with the same style as normal media photos with background and caption. No associated links yet.

= Bug fixes =

* The 'Slideshow' and 'Browse photos' link now also point to the page selected in the edit album form.

* Due to internal changes, it is most likely that this problem will be fixed: http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-wp-photo-album-plus-page-drops-when-activated-on-page?replies=24#post-1965780
* If you had set *No Links* for thumbnails, you will have to set it again.

= 2.5.1 =

= New features =
* A 'General purpose' Sidebar Widget has been added. It is a text widget wherein you can use wppa+ script commands just like in pages or posts.

= Bug Fixes =
* This version includes all 21 hot fixes released after the initial release of version 2.5.0 and some minor cosmetic ccorrections.

= Hot fixes after initial release =
* 001: Changed the way new settings get their default values during plugin activation.
* 002: Reset %%size=.. at end of widget code to prevent inheritage of wrong size in case widget is rendered before main column.
* 003: Added vertical alignment and text above photos in slideshow widget.
* 004: The words Start and Stop are now translatable.

= 2.5.0 =

= New Features =
* A rating system has been implemented.
* A TopTen Sidebar Widget has been added.
* You can enter a custom url and title for the link from the Photo of the day.
* There is a new module: Export. This enables you to transfer entire treestructures of albums with photos from one WP installlation to another.
It is also usefull for backup purposes. If your php version is at least 5.2.7, a zip-file will be created that contains all the required information and photos.
If your php version is older, a bunch of files is created, `.pmf` being 'photo meta file', containing name and description of the photo and the album it belongs to. `.amf` being 'album meta files' that hold the album name and description. `.jpg/.png/.gif` being the pictures.
Because it is allowed for a photo to not have a name, and it is allowed for multiple photos to have the same name within an album, 
it is not possible to check for duplicate photos.
So, be carefull not to import transferred photos more than once or you will end up with duplicate pictures.
A spin off of this module is that you can now upload a zip-file that contains photos only that can be imported.
The import of zip files is done in two passes, in the first pass you can select the zipfiles to be extracted, 
the second pass enables you to select the photos and albums you want to import.

= Enhancements =
* All three widgets are now dynamic. You will need to re-activate the Photo of the Day and the Search widget after upgrade.
* An attempt will be made to recover from a manually performed update without de- and re-activation the first time you enter a WPPA+ addmin page.
* Added thumbnail text font-family and size settable in the Settings screen.

= Bug Fixes =
* Fixed an errormessage on activation of the plugin in debug mode.
* Fixed W3C Validator errors and warnings.
* Fixed a bug where thumbnail text did not recognize html while html allowed in descriptions.

= Hot fixes after initial release =
* 001: Fix empty thumbnail page when n <= treshold.
* 002: Fix parse error during installation due to conflict with other plugin or theme changed ZipArchive::CREATE to 1.
* 003: Added CHMOD support in settings page.
* 004: Do not set default rights on creation of dirs, use settings page instead.
* 005: Slideonly defined. %%slideonly=.. is like %%slide=.. but without nav bars and always running.
* 006: Patch for IE, give calculated width to textframe in covers, float and position.
* 007: Patch to work patch 006 in variable column width.
* 008: You can display covers in 2 or 3 columns if the display area is wider than given numbers of pixels.
* 009: Fixed a warning in import photos where .pmf files do not exist. Added margin:0 for cover images for patch 006 to work in certain themes.
* 010: Protect rating system with nonce field. Moved 2 sec delay from js to php, to work in refresh page.
* 011: Fixed slashes in thumbnail popup descriptions.
* 012: Thumbnails can now be auto spaced while margin is a minimum.
* 013: You can now import photos from any (sub)directory starting at wp-content/uploads, hence from the wp media dir.
* 014: Fixed Album not found err during import when there are quotes in the album and the parents album name. 
       Import will now attempt to use old album and photo id's when previously exported. 
       This improves the usability of the export/import mechanism as a backup tool.
* 015: Fixed missing slideonly in RSS.
* 016: New widget added: Slideshow Widget. For clearity: all WPPA+ widgets have 'WPPA+' in their description.
* 017: The slideshow widget is expanded width: link url, tooltip text, own timeout timer and subtitle.
       Fixed a w3c validation errror.
* 018: Appearence setting did not work on fullsize name and description. Fixed.
* 019: %%wppa%% %%photo=..%% %%size=..%% %%align=..%% now also works as expected for single portrait images. size = width when single photo.

As nothing in life is permanent, this enhancement revokes the previously announced permanent restriction of having only one occurence of an album or cover in a page or post.

= More in 1.9 =
* You can now have different sizes for thumbnail images and cover photos. The regeneration of thumbnails now only occurs when the largest of the two enters a diffrent range of 25 pixels.
* Fix for sizing problem in IE6 by removing max-width and max-height from the style attributes.
* Fixed rounding error in calculating thumbnail size. This may result in new thumbnails being one pixel larger. Regeneration of thumbnails will overcome this.
* The 'Enlarge fullsize photos' switch in the admin settings page now functions as expected.
* Various small fixes.
* Added wrappers for coverphoto and thumbnails.
* You can now align thumbnails at top, center or bottom.
* Split up the code in functional pieces.
* Added functions: wppa_get_total_album_count(), wppa_get_youngest_album_id() and wppa_get_youngest_album_name() that are simple but not yet documented. For more info see the sourcecode: wppa_functions.php

= 1.8.5 =
* This is an intermediate version that never was released.

= 1.8.4 =
* Browsing photos and the slideshow are merged. You can now easily switch between them. This also fixes the scrolling issue.
* Fix to prevent loading stylesheet more than once.
* Fixed an HTML error where photo description or name contained newline characters.
* Added optional parameters to wppa_get_albums() to make its use more flexible. See: tags.txt.
* Improved security of wppa_get_albums()

= 1.8.3 =
* You can now link a album title and coverphoto to a WP page as opposed to the album's content. The album's content will still be reacheable by the View- and Slideshow links.
* You can now decide not to include a homelink in the breadcrumb navigation.
* Fixed some incomplete / erroneous links.
* While browsing full size images, the double arrow brackets will now have a transparent background.
* Minor fixes and improved error handling.
* There is now a way to automatically scroll back to the desired position when browsing full scale images. For more info: See the section Frequently asked questions.
If you made a copy of wppa_theme.php or wppa_style.css into your theme directory and you want to make full use of the new improvements, please redo your modifications (if still needed) using a fresh copy of the original files.

= 1.8.2 =
* You can now configure a link to a page from the sidebar widget photo.
* The widget will now display the correct subtitle in all cases.
* Security issue: Silence is golden index.php added to all directories.

= 1.8.1 =
* Fixed a fatal error after regeneration of thumbnails

= 1.8 =
* An optional Sidebar Widget has been added.

= 1.7.1 =
* There is now a simple self-explaining way to recover from an interrupted regeneration of thumbnail images.
* Fixed a typo in admin_styles.css.
* Parent album Names rather than Id's are listed in the Manage Albums table.
* Parent Id's can be --- separate ---. They do not appear in the generic album where all albums are listed with a parent set to --- none ---, and are especially ment for use as parent albums (covers) for single albums in posts or pages with correct breadcrumb display.
* When displaying a blog with more than one post using an album, only the first album was displayed. This has been fixed. You can still have only one album per page/post.
* When displaying an album in a page or post, you can now overrule the default full size.
* You can now set the order of photos in an album to the default setting from the Options page.
* You can now specify whether photos may be enlarged to meet the Full Size crteria. Turning off this feature (recommended) will speed up the start of slideshows with hundreds of photos.
